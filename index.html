        <p>This is the second adventure in Statistics. The aim is to use the
          skills you have developed in Further Mathematics to complete the next D&D
          inspired mission. Before you can, you need to have
          mastered both the uni variate and the bi variate components of the course.</p>

      <h2>Upon the completion of the mushroom grove mission, the characters were
        awarded 2 experience points. This means that they can level up before
        they undertake any new missions.<br>
        The above cards introduce them to you and give you some basic stats
        for each. You are told their name, age and shoe size etc.<br>
        It is the other stats that need to change. Their armour class (AC) may
        increase and their hit points (HP) may also increase. With only two
        experience points their damage dealt will be unchanged.<br>
        <em><a href="img/ACandHPdata.png" target="_blank">Click</a></em> here to see
        how the number of experience points gained will influence the character
        traits.<br>

        following questions in order to proceed.<br>

          <p>The party, who have now all been levelled up, receive a dispatch
            from the King of Strathweyah. His Daughter, Princess Crysalot, has
            been kidnapped by his adversary from the neighbouring kingdom.<br>
            Steel Gaze immediately embarked on a scouting mission and found that
            the princess is being held in a dungeon guarded by a fierce dragon.
            Steel brings back a drawing of the dragon and you immediately start
            researching the breed.<br>
            You find a reference in an ancient scroll that tells the tale of a
            past quest. It too involved this type of dragon. The scroll eludes to
            the fact that these dragons are only active when the temperature
            exceeds 8.0 <sup>o</sup>C. Any colder than that and a stealthy
            warrior can sneak past.
